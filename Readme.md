#  Kiwibank tech assesment



# Overview
This assessment will display a list of transactions, totals, as well as allowing for filtering of data.
Please refer to the images Example 1 & Example 2 for the layout of the screen. Your design does not need to exactly match what is shown,
we are primarily looking to understand how you structure and write code.

You will be assessed on the following criteria

Functionality: How well your solution meets the requirements.
Code quality: Your coding style, structure, and maintainability.
Problem-solving: Your ability to understand the problem and create a solution.



# Your task:
Implement the following functionality:
- Display list of transactions to the user
- Add a date filter to only show transactions between two given dates (use default ios DatePicker) if enabled
- Calculate and display the total ingoing and outgoing amounts at the top of the screen based on your filtered data



#Additional notes:
Think of this assessment as a stepping stone within a larger product! Your goal is to showcase your
production-level coding practices while demonstrating problem-solving abilities.

However, We recommend allocating no more than 4 hours for this assessment. If you find yourself
exceeding this time, feel free to discuss your progress and any challenges you've encountered during
the interview.

Feel free to:

Leverage appropriate technologies: Incorporate libraries or frameworks that enhance your solution.
Customize your approach: Modify the code structure/data structure or use different techniques to
align with your preferred style or problem-solving strategies.

We look forward to discussing your solution and learning more about your skills in the
next round of interviews.

Good luck!
